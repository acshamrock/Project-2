      <h2>These are words I think are really cool for varying reasons</h2>
      <p>Most of these words do not come up often in everyday conversation, so I find them very interesting. I have different reasons for liking these words; I enjoy most of them because they are so unique and uncommon to see. I cannot list all of the words I find awesome since there are too many; hopefully, you enjoy this abbreviated list.</p>
